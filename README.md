##About

LevenshteinAutomaton is a fast and comprehensive Java library capable of performing automaton and non-automaton 
based Damerau-Levenshtein distance determination and neighbor calculations. The collection of related utilities affords developers 
the luxury of choosing the most appropriate edit distance-related procedure for their needs at any given time.
 
The library is capable of the following:

- Edit-distance determination (via dynamic programming) 
- Edit-distance neighbor determination (via dynamic programming)
- Edit-distance neighbor dictionary search (via table, dynamic programming, or automaton traversal)
 
The code well structured, easy to follow, and extensively commented for the benefit of developers 
seeking to understand the implemented data structures and algorithms, as well as developers seeking
to add homogeneous, functionality-extending code with ease.

The code has also been fully tested for correct functionality and performance.

##How to use

    //Determine the edit distance between two words
    int editDistance = LevenshteinAutomaton.computeEditDistance("tree", "trees"); //1
    
    //Determine if two strings are within a given edit distance of each other
	boolean areLDNeighbors = LevenshteinAutomaton.areWithinEditDistanceNonAutomaton(1, "tree", "trees"); //true
	
	//Create dictionary-containing data structures
	ArrayList<String> myArrayList = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(new String[]{"bush", "bushes", "tree", "trees"}));
	MDAG myMDAG = new MDAG(myArrayList);
	/////
	
	//Detemine via table all of the Strings in the our dictionary that are within a edit distance 2 from "tree"  (ideal use cases: edit distances <= 2)
	LinkedList<String> ldNeighborsLinkedList = LevenshteinAutomaton.tableFuzzySearch(2, "tree", myMDAG); //"tree", "trees"
	
	//Detemine via dynamic programming all of the Strings in the our dictionary that are within a edit distance  2 from "tree" (ideal use cases: low memory capacity, edit distances >= 2)
	LinkedList<String> ldNeighborsLinkedList = LevenshteinAutomaton.fuzzySearchNonAutomaton(2, "tree", myArrayList); //"tree", "trees"
	
	//Detemine via automaton traversal all of the Strings in the our dictionary that are within a edit distance  2 from "tree"
	LinkedList<String> ldNeighborsLinkedList = LevenshteinAutomaton.iterativeFuzzySearch(2, "tree", myMDAG); //"tree", "trees"

##Licensing and usage information

LevenshteinAutomaton is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Informally, It'd be great to be notified of any derivatives or forks (or even better, issues or refactoring points that may inspire one)!

More informally, it'd **really** be great to be notified any uses in open-source, educational, or (if granted a license) commercial contexts.
